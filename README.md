TechClub is a community tailored for individuals who possess a strong foundation in computer literacy and are actively engaged in their own tech-oriented projects. Our club serves as a collaborative space where members with skills and a passion for technology can come together to exchange ideas, share expertise, and collaborate on innovative projects.

Please note that TechClub is a non instructional support group and cannot cater for those without basic computer skills. If this is you, please contact the [Mid North Coast Community College](https://www.mnccc.edu.au/) for introduction to computers courses.

## What do we do?

Example projects would be 3D printing, electronics, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Coding, [RoboWars](https://www.robowars.com.au/), AI, building drones and other RC craft, etc.  

Have a look at the [Show and Tell](https://github.com/NathanDigital/TechClub/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) to see what some of our members are working on.

## When and Where?
